Experimenting with static sites
=====

This is an experiment to deliver a seemingly dynamic site by using web
services and AJAX rather than a dynamic web server. The site is written
using the [jekyll][] publishing tools, runs mostly on [Amazon Web
Services][AWS] systems, and follows the pattern of [some][mojombo]
[other][werner] [sites][ascarter-github].
